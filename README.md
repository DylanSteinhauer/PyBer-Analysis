# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type
by using Pandas and Matplotlib.
## Results
![Summary_df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87148177/133000077-a7f30304-c9a7-4ac7-809a-6343bb625402.png)
When looking at the Summary dataframe, we see that there are significantly more drivers and rides in urban cities
than both suburban and rural cities. Also, total urban fares outnumbers the fare totals of suburban and rural cities combined. 
However, the average fare per ride is lowest in urban cities. 
In addition, the average fare per driver is much lower in urban cities compared to rural and suburban.
